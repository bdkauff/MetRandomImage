This is a simple Node script written for the purpose of exploring various musueum API's, mostly for my own research.

The route '/scrapi/random' is a little bit more fun. Piggybacking on the very cool [scrAPI](https://github.com/jedahan/collections-api/blob/master/Readme.md), this will return a random (and hi-res) image from the Metropolitan Museum's website, which makes available to the public upwards of 300,000 object images! A live Heroku instance can be found at http://scrapi-random.herokuapp.com. Simply click anywhere on the page to get a new object.
