This is a simple Node script written for the purpose of exploring various musueum API's, mostly for my own research on museum API's and archiving. 

The route '/scrapi/random' is a little bit more fun. Piggybacking on [scrAPI](https://github.com/jedahan/collections-api/blob/master/Readme.md), this will return a random (and hi-res) image from the Metropolitan Museum's website.
